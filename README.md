Hey! I'm Posandu - a student from Sri Lanka who is interested in computers (and Svelte!).

### What tools/programming languages do I use?

These programming languages are the ones I use most:

- JavaScript/TypeScript 
- CSS/HTML
- Svelte
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- Rust
- C++ (A bit of Arduino programming)

And these tools help me:

- VS Code and Sublime Text as text editors
- Windows 11 as the operating system
- GitHub for hosting code
- Vercel for hosting apps
- Notepad for taking notes
- Svelte(Kit), PHP, Next.js for developing apps
